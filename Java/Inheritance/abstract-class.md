## Abstract class

**Intro**

A basis for other classes.

Should move common fields and methods to superclass (whether abstract or not).

No implementation required.

A class with one or more abstract methods
must be declared abstract.

Can have fields and concrete methods.

Cannot be instantiated.

Can create variables of an abstract class.

**Extend by subclass**

Abstract methods act as placeholders
for subclass methods.
